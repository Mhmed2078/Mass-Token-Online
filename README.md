# Mass-Token-Online
A script designed to simulate online status for multiple discord tokens. Please give better name ideas for this man :sob:


## About

Uses Discord's Discord Gateway API to authenticate and maintain a connection for each token. This allows each token to be seen as Online, with a specific Identify packet each token is visualised as on Mobile.


## Usage

Place tokens in tokens.txt, and then run Main.py.
